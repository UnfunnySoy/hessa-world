## Overview
The Harbsend College of Sorcery is a university that sits at the heart of the city of [[Civilizations/Harbsend\|Harbsend]] known for its efforts in arcane research, [[Creativity\|creative spell development]], and magical teachings. Although the college is located in the city of [[Civilizations/Harbsend\|Harbsend]], the academy has alumni and researchers placed all across [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. The college makes an effort to allow students to learn many aspects of modern magic while allowing students to make most of the decisions regarding what is learned and researched. As such, learned material at the college is often nonstandard and requires great versatility and flexibility of knowledge. Graduates of the college often quickly find jobs as researchers, general spellcasters, security specialists, and special-use spellcasters in high-paying positions often in the service of a noble family. 

Digging deeper into the school structure, a simple hierarchy is uncovered. At the top of the school’s structure is a board of alumni known as the Elders. There are typically ten elders in total who make decisions regarding the university’s funding and research grants, student discipline, facility maintenance, public image, and more. The Elders maintain structure and order in the college, making sure that it stays a place of knowledge and upholds standards regarding student safety, educational excellence, academic integrity, community involvement, intellectual compassion, and more. The Elders stand as the backbone of the entire university, providing structure and security to all attending students. Elders are elected until ten Elders sit on the board and serve until resignation or death. As such, elections are rare and heavily favor races with long lifespans.
