## Overview
[[Hessa\|Hessa]], as a commonwealth, is split into four provinces. The provinces, although serving as constituent parts for the [Hessan](Hessa) commonwealth, often have numerous differences regarding governmental duties, protections for citizens, taxation, and law. Annually, leaders of each of the provinces meet to discuss universal [Hessan](Hessa) law, discuss policy changes, and address threats to the [Hessan](Hessa) people.
