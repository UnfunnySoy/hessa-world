## Overview
There are numerous poisons made from the natural toxins found in the [[Hessa\|Hessan]] wild.
## [[Wildlife/Flora/Shardstem\|Shardstem]] Sap
The [[Wildlife/Flora/Shardstem\|shardstem]] plant creates a thick, milky sap when cut into. When enough of the sap is ingested, the brutal effects of the poison quickly become apparent. An individual subjected to the poison becomes feverish and begins sweating profusely. While sweating in this way, a victim begins to have minor hallucinations which often include visions of the dead, hearing voices from "beyond" the world, and paranoia. These hallucinations paired with high body temperatures and constant sweating frequently lead to vomiting and difficulty completing simple tasks. The poison's effects typically only last for about an hour and rarely lead to death in a victim.
## [[Wildlife/Flora/Hushflower\|Hushflower]] Extract
[[Wildlife/Flora/Hushflower\|Hushflower]] petals, when soaked in oil or a strong alcohol for a few months, can create a thin, rosy fluid with a sickly vanilla smell. An individual who consumes an ample amount of the extract begins to feel the effects of the substance immediately, falling asleep outright or futilely attempting to maintain consciousness. The extract promptly loses potency after a victim passes out, meaning that an individual subject to the substance will continue to sleep for about an hour or until they are disturbed.
## [[Wildlife/Flora/Tarboul Toadstool\|Tarboul]] Distillation
The boiled flesh of the [[Wildlife/Flora/Tarboul Toadstool\|tarboul toadstool]] creates a thin, dark solution which can be reduced into a potent, dark fluid. The poison is somewhat delicate and is rendered inert by a small amount of a high-proof alcohol. The poison, once consumed by an individual, causes the  trachea to swell and close swiftly. This often leads to violent suffocation which kills the victim within a few minutes. If the victim is able to drink enough of a sufficiently strong spirit before their suffocation, the poison will be rendered inert and the victim will be able to breathe normally.
## Powdered [[Wildlife/Flora/Meadwood Mushroom\|Meadwood]]
Once dried, the raw [[Wildlife/Flora/Meadwood Mushroom\|meadwood mushroom]] can be processed into a fine amber powder. This powder, when consumed, often causes swift digestive irritation which quickly leads to discomfort and vomiting. This poison takes effect very quickly, and its nonlethal and somewhat useful effects make it a commonly used medicinal substance to induce vomiting and to void the bowels of a patient.
