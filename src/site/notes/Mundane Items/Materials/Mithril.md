## Overview
Mithril is a mythical metal found within the depths of the [Hessan](Hessa) underground. In its pure form, mithril is a lustrous, pale green metal with strength and hardness similar to steel. When heated, mithril becomes malleable, making it able to be forged into various metal items. Uniquely, mithril is extremely lightweight (about a quarter the density of steel), making it a very useful metal for forging armor and for applications where weight is a large priority. Mithril is an extremely rare metal that permeated much of early [[Hessa\|Hessa]] during [[Major History/The Unearthing\|The Unearthing]] when the [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) were first introduced to the [snow elves](Snow%Elf). Mithril was used as both a trade metal and a crafting material during this time, being fashioned into coins and being used to make durable artifacts and weapons.
