## Overview
Throny is an bone-like substance that forms into plates of armor around the body of the [Hessan great cow](Hessan%20Great%20Cow). Similar in color and hardness to ivory, throny forms itself into curved slabs that cover sensitive parts of the body of the [great cow](Hessan%20Great%20Cow) and grant extra protection against predators. As a material, throny is used in various applications, most of which include some form of carving or shaping of the throny into sculptures or ornamental items. Due to the importance of the [great cow](Hessan%20Great%20Cow) in [Hessan](Hessa) culture, throny has become a culturally significant material with a value tied to its importance in crafting items of luxury. Throny also has a number of alchemical uses, often being used as a basis for a number of tinctures, potions, and salves.
