## Overview
Adamantine is a rare metallic alloy produced from combining adamantite, a brittle metal found occasionally in large veins deep underground, iron, and gold. In its strongest alloyed form, adamantine is a dark, crimson metal known for its legendary hardness and durability. When heated, adamantine becomes workable, though difficult and time consuming to forge. Adamantine is one of the strongest materials known throughout [[Hessa\|Hessa]], and its use in the crafting of weapons and armor was reserved for only the most important works. The first alloy of adamantine is said to have been forged by the [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) during the [[Major History/Age of God and Man\|Age of God and Man]] after the [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]] had granted them the gift of life. Adamantine permeates the legends of [Hessan](Hessa) forge work, rarely being described outside of masterwork items.
