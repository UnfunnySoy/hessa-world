## Overview
A long period of [[Hessa\|Hessan]] history known as The Unearthing describes the introduction of the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|deep dwarves]] born by the great [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]] to the [[Races/Snow Elf\|snow elves]] of the surface world. After initial introductions and a wave of trade between the early [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]] and [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]], a great war broke out as the [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] desired the wealth and material wealth of the ground dwellers. The Unearthing marks the start of written history in [[Hessa\|Hessa]], serving as a point where historical accounts can be effectively understood and cross referenced with one another to paint a clear picture of the early world.
## The Beginnings of the Noble Families of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]
Just as the [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] were beginning the process of recording their history on tablets of wood and stone, families of nobility and power were becoming prevalent in [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. During the [[Major History/Age of God and Man\|Age of God and Man]] after the gods of the [[Pantheons/Elven Pantheon\|elven pantheon]] were born from the tears of [[Pantheons/Elven Pantheon/Faenivere\|Faenivere]], the gods walked in the realm of the [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]], taking students with them to learn from their lessons and master themselves. The students of these gods became teachers themselves, gathering large followings and producing large, prosperous lineages which would become the noble [[Arie Dynasty\|Arie]], [[Brayshor Circle\|Brayshor]], and [[Yittrian Noble Family\|Yittrian]] families. The gods then left the realm of the [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] as their bodies slowly expired.
## The Revealing of the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|Dwarves]] to the [[Races/Snow Elf\|Elves]]
Early accounts describe the discovery of the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarven]] cities by the [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] as a moment of great excitement and intrigue. As families of nobility took their places at the forefront of [[Hessa\|Hessan]] culture and rule, a great earthquake tore through [[Hessa\|Hessa]], altering the geography of the world in a way which created numerous small fissures and sinkholes across wooded regions of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. Curious [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] during this time found the fissures while adventuring, and explored the nearby surface caves. Before too long, the underground cities of the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]] were revealed to them in full. The [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] were completely ecstatic at the discovery of the underground cities of the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]], and the  [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]] were curious about the surface in which the [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] originated from. The [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] began by trading goods from their world for the currency of the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]]. When the [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] were introduced to [[Mundane Items/Materials/Mithril\|mithril]] by the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]] through trade, families of nobility, striving to increase their power and rule, rushed to collect as much of the rare metal as possible. During this time, the  [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]] and [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] lived in unison, with [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]] inhabiting the [[Races/Snow Elf\|elven]] cites of 

After many years of peaceful trade, tensions between the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]] and [[Races/Snow Elf\|elves]] 

[[Manathus Arie\|Manathus Arie]], head of the [[Arie Dynasty\|Arie Dynasty]], shared a sentiment before the other noble elven houses. [[Manathus Arie\|Manathus]] believed that the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]], with their otherworldly resources and magic, were a threat to [[Hessa\|Hessa]], and he believed that their faith in the [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]] would undermine the authority of the noble families, as their upbringings by the [[Pantheons/Elven Pantheon\|gods of Hessa]] gave them authority and strength over others. [[Manathus Arie\|Manathus Arie]] ultimately convinced the other family heads that a war would be prudent, and began gathering his forces against the [[Races/Deep Dwarf\|dwarves]].
