## Overview
A long period of [Hessan](Hessa) history known as The Unearthing describes the introduction of the [deep dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) born by the great [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]] to the [snow elves](Snow%20Elf) of the surface world. After initial introductions and a wave of trade between the early [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) and [elves](Snow%20Elf), a great war broke out as the [elves](Snow%20Elf) desired the wealth and material wealth of the ground dwellers. The Unearthing marks the start of written history in [[Hessa\|Hessa]], serving as a point where historical accounts can be effectively understood and cross referenced with one another to paint a clear picture of the early world.
## The Beginnings of the Noble Families of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]
Just as the [elves](Snow%20Elf) were beginning the process of recording their history on tablets of wood and stone, families of nobility and power were becoming prevalent in [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. During the [[Major History/Age of God and Man\|Age of God and Man]] after the gods of the [elven pantheon](Elven%20Pantheon) were born from the tears of [[Pantheons/Elven Pantheon/Faenivere\|Faenivere]], the gods walked in the realm of the [elves](Snow%20Elf), taking students with them to learn from their lessons and master themselves. The students of these gods became teachers themselves, gathering large followings and producing large, prosperous lineages which would become the noble [Arie](Arie%20Dynasty), [Brayshor](Brayshor%20Circle), and [Yittrian](Yittrian%20Noble%20Family) families. The gods then left the realm of the [elves](Snow%20Elf).
## The Revealing of the [Dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) to the [Elves](Snow%20Elf)
Early accounts describe the discovery of the [dwarven](Deep%20Dwarf) cities by the [elves](Snow%20Elf) as a moment of great excitement and intrigue. A great earthquake tore through [[Hessa\|Hessa]] as families of nobility took their places at the forefront of [Hessan](Hessa) culture and rule, altering the geography of the world in a way which created numerous small fissures and sinkholes across wooded regions of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. Curious [elves](Snow%20Elf) during this time found the fissures while adventuring, and explored the nearby surface caves. Before too long, the underground cities of the [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) were revealed to them in full. The [elves](Snow%20Elf) were completely ecstatic at the discovery of the underground cities of the [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf), and the [dwarves](Deep%Dwarf) were curious about the surface in which the [elves](Snow%20Elf) originated from. The [elves](Snow%20Elf) began by trading goods from their world for the currency of the [dwarves](Deep%Dwarf). When the [elves](Snow%20Elf) were introduced to [mithril](Mithril) by the [dwarves](Deep%Dwarf) through trade, families of nobility, striving to increase their power and rule, rushed to collect as much of the rare metal as possible. After many years of peaceful trade, [[Manathus Arie\|Manathus Arie]], head of the [[Arie Dynasty\|Arie Dynasty]], shared a sentiment before the other noble elven houses. [Manathus](Manathus%20Arie) believed that the [dwarves](Deep%Dwarf), with their otherworldly resources and magic, were a threat to [[Hessa\|Hessa]], and he believed that their faith in a great [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]] would undermine the authority of the noble families. [[Manathus Arie\|Manathus Arie]] ultimately convinced the other family heads that a war would be prudent.
