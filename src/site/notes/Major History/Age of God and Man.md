## Overview
The early history of [[Hessa\|Hessa]], called by scholars as The Age of God and Man, is greatly metaphorical in nature, acting as stories to hone the beliefs of the inhabiting races of [[Hessa\|Hessa]] and serve as a baseline for religious beliefs throughout the commonwealth. 
### The Elves
In the beginning of [Hessan](Hessa) history, it is said that the god of the elves, [[Faenivere\|Faenivere]], created the [elves](Snow%20Elf) from snow, ice, and air. [[Faenivere\|Faenivere]] then rested, calling upon the [elves](Snow%20Elf) that they created to eat and grow and sleep. The [elves](Snow%20Elf) formed tribes and began to grow together, battling against the harshness of the wilderness. They created tools to build their homes and fire to warm their hearths, but when the [Hessan](Hessa) nights grew long and cold, the [elves](Snow%20Elf) grew weary and weak, unsure of their connection to their god and unsure of how to survive the hostilities of nature. They praised [[Faenivere\|Faenivere]] and cried out for guidance, asking that they be shown how to protect their tribes and their people. When [[Faenivere\|Faenivere]] emerged from their slumber, they saw the state of the [elves](Snow%20Elf) and wept. From their tears grew [the other gods](Elven%20Pantheon) of the [elves](Snow%20Elf). These [gods](Elven%20Pantheon) aided the [elves](Snow%20Elf) of [[Hessa\|Hessa]], strengthening their skills and resolve. After this, [[Faenivere\|Faenivere]] returned to sleep. Instilled with aspiration from the advent of [gods](Elven%20Pantheon) and ideals to strive for, the [elves](Snow%20Elf) became strong, developing writing, math, and a culture of hard work and enduring fortitude. The elves innovated, celebrating their [gods](Elven%20Pantheon) with fervor and love. They learned agriculture from [[Vin\|Vin]], praised [[Heth\|Heth]] for their health and strength, studied alongside [[Jeshe\|Jeshe]], praised [[Sot\|Sot]] for favorable weather, and learned magic from [[Lairus\|Lairus]].
### The Dwarves
During this time, [deep dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) were being forged from stone in the depths of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. The [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]] deep in the Earthâ€™s womb built a great number of [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) to push forth and create wondrous cities of stone deep beneath the surface. The [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) crafted a culture of stoic kindness, honing their minds into fortresses capable of great forgiveness and compassion. The [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) explored their subterranean habitat, finding various wonders and harvesting the bounties of the below. Wishing to please the great [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]], the [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) brought their treasures to him. Looking upon his creation, the [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]] smiled. He took the treasures of the [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) and thought it would be right that they could be more. The [[Craftsman\|Craftsman]] took the [dwarves](Deep%Dwarf) and granted them the gift of life, allowing them to reproduce and accomplish great projects. The [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) went forth and created sprawling cities and wondrous artifacts with powerful enchantments in the depths of the world.
