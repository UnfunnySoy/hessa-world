## Overview
Known for its frosted, forested landscape, Hessa is a frigid and consistent boreal forest where great animals march to isolated rhythms of icy solitude. Civilization is unsettled, and villages are few and far in between the sprawling forests of spruce and pine. Of the cities and towns present in Hessa, [snow elves](Snow%20Elf) tend to constitute most of the populations; however, other races also inhabit villages and cities such as [humans](Human) and [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf).

The culture in Hessa is mostly single-minded with most individuals valuing peace, tradition, seclusion, and simple living. Hard work and pride are common values throughout Hessa, and it is often believed that rest and leisure must be hard-fought and earned. The values and traditions of Hessa often play into this fact, often placing pressure on working individuals to produce the best work possible and to approach mastery. Development of the self in both an occupational and a spiritual context is often extremely important in Hessan culture, and most Hessans tend to follow a common philosophy that describes how improvement of the self leads to betterment of the world around oneself. 

Due to the region being mostly comprised of longer-living races such as [dwarves](Deep%20Dwarf) and [elves](Snow%20Elf), life is often slow in Hessa. Traditions and beliefs are oftentimes unchanging for centuries at a time, and new ideas are seldom incorporated into society due to an unwillingness to change. As such, research of magic and study of natural sciences is often slow, but thorough, developed, and refined. As such, Hessan innovators in magic, mathematics, and earth sciences are often very skilled in specific fields of study, making them strong researchers, craftsmen, and intellectuals.

Community is very important in Hessan culture. After many years of self improvement and occupational growth, it is believed that Hessan adults should give back to their community and share their knowledge. Oftentimes, adults will work until they have enough money for a “bremrest,” or “little break.” During the bremrest, adults will build families, raise children, and teach young adults trades or other skills. Additionally, adults may also complete any mandatory service or attempt to learn new skills during a bremrest, allowing them to change the direction of their lives and study other interests. After bremrest, an adult may return to work or pursue another path for their lives. Many years after bremrest, an adult might choose to finally retire. At this point, it is expected that the adult’s family take care of them as they live out the final years of their lives.

Hessa is a commonwealth. Each city and surrounding district has their own local laws; however, many laws are uniform across the commonwealth. United under common beliefs of freedom, hard work, and communal growth, Hessa strives to have every citizen able to help support their community. Taxes are collected locally. Taxpayer money is often invested directly back into the community to help support local professions and work, providing a proper basis for growth of human capital in Hessa.
