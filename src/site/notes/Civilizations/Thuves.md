## Overview
Thuves is a major snow elf city in the northwest of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. The city of Thuves is ancient, and its inhabitants are well-aged and experienced. Isolated from much of the outside world within large enchanted walls of ice, a thriving civilization of experienced spellcasters and craftsmen experiment with their knowledge and raise their works to legendary status. Here, ancient, primal magics are studied and experimented with, creating simple and fundamental theories for the origins of magic native to the world. Artifacts and masterwork items are studied with the intent of reinforcing and improving manufacturing traditions of centuries past. Great libraries within the center of the city stand to protect ancient knowledge and make Thuves a place of great historical research. When breakthroughs occur in Thuves, the advances are not quickly shared throughout the commonwealth. Oftentimes, advances take decades to be reflected in everyday life, with only a few innovators properly able to access learned information and utilize it outside of the city walls. Thuves is a city limited by its great walls of ice and prerequisites for entry, standing at a population of just under 23,000 inhabitants.
