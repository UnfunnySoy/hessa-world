## Overview
Felmsgrace is a decorated [snow elf](Snow%20Elf) and [human](Human) city in the north of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. The city is constructed out of many domes of enchanted, transparent ice which each contain beautiful and detailed environments. The air outside of Felmsgrace is frigid and biting; however, the interiors of each dome are comfortable and warm. Within each of the manufactured environments, there are various potion ingredients cultivated alongside warm and welcoming shelters for other various wildlife. This makes Felmsgrace a place of study in agriculture and manufactured environments alongside magical infrastructure and luxury. Outside the enchanted domes of the inner city lie many large cabins of solid construction. Here, the markets thrive and a majority of the population resides. Felmsgrace is a place of research, home to the nationâ€™s Grand Observatory where celestial studies are completed. Transportation through this portion of the commonwealth is often done through teams of sled dogs, and Felmsgrace takes great care to raise strong and capable hounds to weather the ice and snow. Felmsgrace stands at a crowded, but comfortable 32,000 inhabitants.
