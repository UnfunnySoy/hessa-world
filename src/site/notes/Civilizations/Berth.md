## Overview
Berth is a cattle-raising village north of the city of [[Civilizations/Helpherfrust\|Helpherfrust]]. Berth, with its northern preference and proximity to [[Civilizations/Helpherfrust\|Helpherfrust]] is largely home to populations of [humans](Human) and [snow elves](Snow%20Elf) who are well equipped for the colder temperatures. There are about 600 permanent inhabitants of Berth, but the number of individuals present in the village fluctuates frequently with numerous travelers and merchants from [[Civilizations/Helpherfrust\|Helpherfrust]] heading north to [[Civilizations/Felmsgrace\|Felmsgrace]] and northwest in the direction of [[Civilizations/Harbsend\|Harbsend]]. Workers in Berth have a large number of responsibilities during day to day life, including typical farm maintenance, feeding of animals, crop maintenance, and more. Lacking in a formal guard force, Berth relies heavily on both a civilian militia and on the aid of nobles and knights from the city of [[Civilizations/Helpherfrust\|Helpherfrust]]. A representative of the [[Olesya Noble Family\|Olesya Noble Family]] inhabits Berth with a knight at their side, serving as a peacekeeper, tax collector, and voice for the citizens of Berth. 
## Resources
Berth has a wide range of resources both from the growing of crops to the raising of animals. Berth grows numerous crops, including [inerga roots](Inerga%20Root), oats, buckwheat, and onions. Often, a large portion of buckwheat and oat crops are used to feed cattle for the farm owners, while root vegetables are stored, eaten, and sold by farmers. Berth has a variety of animal resources, such as honey from bees as well as meat, milk, fat, [throny](Throny), and hides from the [[Wildlife/Fauna and Monstra/Hessan Great Cow\|Hessan Great Cow]].
## Climate
The climate in Berth is cold a large majority of the year, with summer temperatures not frequently exceeding 75Â°F and winter temperatures falling to as low as -25Â°F. Berth frequently receives small amounts of precipitation, with small storms bringing damp conditions during the summers and minor snow storms loosely and consistently blanketing the village in the winter. 
## Points of Interest
### Shrine of [[Pantheons/Elven Pantheon/Sot\|Sot]]
At the end of the fall and autumn months, Berth begins feverishly preparing for the fast-approaching winter. Part of these preparations includes the harvesting of any remaining crops, the maintenance of important structures such as homes and barns, and the storage of any remaining goods. These preparations culminate in 9 days of prayer to [[Pantheons/Elven Pantheon/Sot\|Sot]], the god of weather and nature. At the end of these 9 days, inhabitants of Berth climb to the top of a nearby hill and engage in a festival to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Together, they share a large meal and set off paper lanterns into the night sky as an expression of hope and a prayer to [[Pantheons/Elven Pantheon/Sot\|Sot]], wishing for a winter of favorable weather and calmness.
### The Hibernation
The Hibernation is Berth's largest tavern and inn. Named after the survival technique large mammals use to endure the winter, The Hibernation is a place for travelers to escape the cold and rest themselves before they continue their journey. The tavern portion has seating and serves food and drink, and the inn portion of The Hibernation has rooms to stay in. With the number of travelers that pass through Berth, The Hibernation generally makes great business. The Hibernation serves as both a local mixing spot as well as a brief respite for travelers, making it a unique location to learn information and engage with the people of Berth.
### Lake Guile
Lake Guile is a small body of water that Berth is built near. The lake serves many purposes, but, primarily, it serves as a source of drinking water, fish, and recreation for many. The lake frequently freezes during the winter months, making it a unique attraction for ice fishing and skating. During the summer, small boats populate the surface of the lake carrying fishermen, catching fish such as the [[Wildlife/Fauna and Monstra/Eastern Ice Perch\|Eastern Ice Perch]], and swimmers. The lake is fed by underground spring and by snowmelt and loses water via a minor creek which trails into the [[Bay of Ryo\|Bay of Ryo]]. The lake is named after a children's story in which a mischievous water spirit would disguise itself as passed loved ones and beckon people to the water's edge, where they would promptly drown.
## Complications
### Missing Cattle
Recently in Berth, farmers have been reporting a foreign illness taking the lives of cattle. This is a great concern to the farmers of Berth, as the [[Wildlife/Fauna and Monstra/Hessan Great Cow\|Hessan Great Cow]] serves as a major source of income and resources for the village. Farmers report infected [cows](Hessan%20Great%20Cow) as slow to react to danger, blind, having a decreased appetite, having frequent loss of balance, and spending much of the day unconscious. The origin of the disease is unknown. Infected [cows](Hessan%20Great%20Cow) often die before the disease runs its course, often passing due to environmental complications emphasized by the disease or being picked off by predators when separated from the herd.
