## Overview
Anthers is a small, cattle-raising hamlet north of [[Wellstone\|Wellstone]]. In Anthers, [snow elves](Snow%20Elf.md) and [humans](Human.md) live and work together, raising cattle and crops together. About 80 people live in Anthers, with travelers sometimes passing through as they travel northwards towards [[Civilizations/Keppit\|Keppit]] or southwards towards [[Wellstone\|Wellstone]]. Most working age persons in Anthers has some sort of agricultural job, spending much of their working hours tending to their fields, raising animals, or processing goods for sale in [[Wellstone\|Wellstone]] markets. Anthers, due to its low population, is lacking in guards or other law enforcement. As such, most mediation and peacekeeping is done by the Barners, a wealthy [elf](Snow%20Elf.md) family that maintains a large farm and has made a minor fortune selling goods in city markets in [[Wellstone\|Wellstone]], [[Civilizations/Stomerstood\|Stomerstood]], and [[Markin\|Markin]]. 
## Resources
Of the resources gathered in Anthers, the most prevalent originate from the [[Wildlife/Fauna and Monstra/Hessan Great Cow\|Hessan Great Cow]]. Most cattle farmers in Anthers make their livings through the butchery of the [cows](Hessan%20Great%20Cow.md) and preparation of their meats, milk, fats, [throny](Throny.md), and hides. Other trade goods from Anthers include [bellblock berries](Bellblock%20Bush.md), [inerga root](Inerga%20Root.md), wool and woolen products, and wheat flour all gathered from farms or foraged in the nearby area. 
## Climate
The climate in Anthers is cold most of the year, with temperatures not frequently exceeding 80°F in the summer and temperatures falling as low as -20°F in the winter. The small village also receives large helpings of rain and snow due to its proximity to the nearby coast and [perpetually frozen lake](Cyra's%20Respite.md). As such, inhabitants of Anthers share a large amount of experience in the maintenance of homes, windmills, barns, and such which are largely fashioned from cobblestone foundations and [thick, waterproof planks of wood](Hessan%20Great%20Pine.md).
## Complications
### Sister Attacks
Recently, life in Anthers has become very difficult and morale has fallen very low. Over the past seven months, Anthers has found itself as the target of five [Sister](Aberrant%20Sisters.md) attacks. During these attacks,  [Sisters](Aberrant%20Sisters.md) have made it a point to abduct children and kill the [cows](Hessan%20Great%20Cow.md) that serve as the lifeblood for the community. As such, many families are finding it difficult to maintain normal lives, and the general outlook is grim. The hamlet has stitched together a small fighting force of men to defend against the attacking [Sisters](Aberrant%20Sisters.md) which has proved just effective enough to prevent a total breakdown of civilization. If the village is unable to protect itself against future [Sister](Aberrant%20Sisters.md) attacks or receive aid of some sort, it is likely to completely collapse.
