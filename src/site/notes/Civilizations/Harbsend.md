## Overview
Harbsend is a large town sat between [[Civilizations/Felmsgrace\|Felmsgrace]] and [[Civilizations/Thuves\|Thuves]]. It serves as a stopping point for travelers making the journey by land or sea into [[Civilizations/Thuves\|Thuves]], but it also has a rich culture of its own. Home to the [[Factions/Harbsend College of Sorcery\|Harbsend College of Sorcery]], Harbsend is a college town with a renowned history of great magical researchers and intellectuals. Constructed over 600 years ago, the [[Factions/Harbsend College of Sorcery\|Harbsend College of Sorcery]] is a renowned institution often tasked with raising some of the finest arcane scholars outside of [[Civilizations/Thuves\|Thuves]]. Spellcasters trying to receive recognition for their accomplishments and gain access to the city of [[Civilizations/Thuves\|Thuves]] often study for a handful of years in the [College](Harbsend%20College%20of%20Sorcery), using the knowledge and recognition gained as leverage to enter the city. Many inhabitants in Harbsend tend to be affiliated with the [College](Harbsend%20College%20of%20Sorcery) as professors, students, researchers, staff, and the like; however, there are others who live hard-working lives in Harbsend unattached to the work of the [College](Harbsend%20College%20of%20Sorcery). Because Harbsend sits on the [[Bay of Ryo\|Bay of Ryo]] and is in close proximity to [[Civilizations/Felmsgrace\|Felmsgrace]], [[Civilizations/Thuves\|Thuves]], and [[Glacier’s Hold\|Glacier’s Hold]], it is a crossroads of local trade between many different cities. As such, many different valuable goods are sold here, such as [shardstem](Shardstem) tapestries, [throny](Throny) carvings, arcane tomes and other books of knowledge, and even unique handcrafted magical items. Over the past century, Harbsend has made greater efforts towards producing magical items for trade and research potential. Harbsend has a population of about 7,000 with over 4,000 of the inhabitants having some connections to the College as students, staff, or alumni.
