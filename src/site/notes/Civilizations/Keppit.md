## Overview
Keppit is a town in the northeastern portion of Hessa. Here, snow elves live in harsh, cold weather near the [[Furious Coast\|Furious Coast]]. Lives are lived quite simply in Keppit; locals fish, hunt, and raise cattle to provide for their families. Trees are felled and used to build homes and the occasional shop. The snow elves in Keppit highly value their isolation, often opting to spend most of their time holed up in their homes or alone in the wilderness. Most who live in Keppit were born and raised there, inheriting a family homestead and living most of their lives maintaining and preserving the simple way of life of the hardworking elf. Occasionally, people from outside of Keppit will decide to live there, favoring the whispering icy winds to the typical sounds of civilization. Researchers and those on bremrest will sometimes spend some time in Keppit to live slowly, practicing skills and seeking spiritual growth. Keppit does very little amounts of trade despite its coastal access, only really trading pelts, oils, furs, and lumber with the southern town of [[Wellstone\|Wellstone]]. The overall population of Keppit is hard to gauge as the city limits are not well defined and the houses are spread so far from each other, but the city likely has around 2,000 inhabitants all living many miles from one another.
