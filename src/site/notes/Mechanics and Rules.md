## Overview
This is a collection of all proposed mechanics and rules that should be implemented if this game is played using Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition rules. This includes homebrew material written by yours truly and by others, optional 5e rules that should be expected, and other mechanics.
## Inspiration
Inspiration is an optional rule outlined in the Player's Handbook. I will run Inspiration as it is detailed in the Player's Handbook, granting inspiration when something narratively satisfying, interesting, or important occurs. Players can grant inspiration that they have received to other players as recognition for powerful character action.
## Multiclassing
Multiclassing is an optional rule outlined in the Player's Handbook. Multiclassing is permitted, but I would encourage players who plan to multiclass to discuss your character progression with me so I can better understand how your character will play in combat and what rewards are most meaningful to your character.
## Feats
Feats are an optional rule outlined in the Player's Handbook. Feats are permitted, but I would ask that players discuss picking a feat with me so that I am properly prepared for the feat in upcoming sessions.
## *Gritty Realism* Rules
*Gritty Realism* is an optional rule detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide that changes how resting works. With base resting rules, a short rest takes 1 hour and a long rest takes 8 hours of game time. With the *Gritty Realism* rules, a short rest takes 8 hours and a long rest takes 1 week. These rules help emphasize some parts of the game that I wish to interact with, such as downtime and adventure preparation. [This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/u5cdoj/5e_gritty_realism_how_it_works_and_why_you_may/) does a good job of explaining some of the philosophy behind using the *Gritty Realism* rules.
## Downtime
Downtime refers to a set of rules outlined in both the Dungeon Master's Guide and Xanathar's Guide to Everything. I will try to use downtime rules frequently throughout the game. For information regarding downtime and how it can be used, [this reddit post can help](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/apblrv/nothing_to_do_a_guide_on_downtime/). The *Training to Gain Levels* downtime option is prohibited.
## Crafting
Crafting rules are outlined in both the Dungeon Master's Guide and Xanathar's Guide to Everything. Similar to downtime, I plan to use the crafting rules outlined in both books (with a few alterations) to allow characters to craft items during downtime. 
## [Homebrew Spells](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llQLKlujjPa3pWAMnABHsEUr1xvFp2KLn7DwPOjtwGM/edit?usp=sharing)
I have created a number of homebrew spells. Each spell has a person or group of origin which details who created the spell. Spells under the *Common* category can be taken during character creation or as part of a level up, but spells under other categories cannot be learned unless certain prerequisites are met.
## [Homebrew Magic Items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gok7-6kKU1rm5ghE3pTen_l8I9DjM7bpysYhdGWnwkg/edit?usp=sharing)
I have created a number of homebrew magic items. These will be used as rewards.
## [Homebrew Races](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h4-oFIC70_2r6SX9buYZWVjvfBY-XtdyNSxewbJlj80/edit?usp=sharing)
I have created a few homebrew racial options. These options are available to players during character creation.
## [Lingering Injuries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sTtKNLwbu4wEjaFvz9t2GieTwtqVViC1LsZ48uT3iE/edit?usp=sharing)
I have found a document which describes some neat lingering injuries. With a few rule adjustments, these injuries and mechanics should be used for raising the stakes of combat encounters.
## [Weapon Styles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JbRAcUY4Bn7FUkXiWT4z9lqz_Xl2HaW8r4D4BG5Ofs4/edit?usp=sharing)
I have created a number of weapon styles which aim to add complexity and more interesting decision making to martial characters during combat. Weapon techniques can be learned from various tutors across [[Hessa\|Hessa]].
