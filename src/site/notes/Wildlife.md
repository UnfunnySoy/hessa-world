## Overview
Many unique forms of life inhabit Hessa, often divided into their [flora](Flora.md) and [fauna](Fauna.md). In addition to these categories, an additional grouping for more [monstrous](Monstra.md) animals has been added. Oftentimes, this category overlaps with some of the creatures and plants in the [fauna](Fauna.md) and [flora](Flora.md) categories.
