## Overview
The [elven](Snow%20Elf) pantheon has a few unique gods. To the common [Hessan](Hessa) citizen, gods are often praised with goals in mind instead of pure faith. As such, individuals make prayers to gods less as a religious practice and more as a custom. Gods in [elven](Snow%20Elf) culture are not seen as omnipotent beings of great control, but rather they are seen as concepts of perfection and examples of what one should strive for in their work or revere in their lives. Sometimes, the gods are seen as teachers, instructors, overseers, and leaders in their abilities to set examples and provide guidance to those who make their prayers.Â Workers praise [[Jeshe\|Jeshe]] for assurance in crafting. Merchants praise [[Sot\|Sot]] for guidance during long travels. Researchers praise [[Pask\|Pask]] for sharpness of mind before performing an experiment. All of these seemingly religious acts are more expressions of hope, calling upon a higher power to watch over someone and serve as a guiding hand and instructor for one to meet their goals. Although pure faith has fallen to the wayside in the past couple of centuries, the pantheon of gods still shines through in the [elven](Snow%20Elf) culture of improvement, growth, hard-work, and discipline.
