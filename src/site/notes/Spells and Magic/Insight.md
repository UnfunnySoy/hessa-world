## Overview

Insight is a learning method for spells in which an individual is exposed to an extraordinary event or idea that heavily influences their thought processes and understanding of their world. Insight learning is very subjective in nature, and, as such, spells learned through insight are variable and noticeably unique between casters. Most commonly, a spell is learned through insight when a caster is personally exposed to an influential event or idea; however, it is possible for a written description, an illustration, a song, or another form of media to convey an idea in such a profound way that a spell might be learned through insight. When a spell is learned through insight, all verbal, somatic, and material components of a spell are intuitively learned; however, they might not be understood in detail.
