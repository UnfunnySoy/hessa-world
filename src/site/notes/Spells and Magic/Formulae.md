## Overview
Once a [model](Models) is produced for a spell, it is possible to create a formula that represents the spell in its entirety. A formula is a more advanced form of a model that often uses math and scientific reasoning to more narrowly describe how a spell takes shape. A formula incorporates multiple variables that dictate how a phenomenon reacts. For example, a formula for the spell burning hands might include variables pertaining to the amount of oxygen present nearby, how much water there is in the air, and the ambient temperature around the caster, as these are all variables that affect how a fire might form in nature. Oftentimes, similar spells share similar variables, allowing for interconnectedness in spells through their variables. Typically, as the number of variables increase, so does the difficulty of learning the spell as well as the potency and complexity of the spellâ€™s effects.
