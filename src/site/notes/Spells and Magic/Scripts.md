Spells, when recorded, are often eccentric representations of the understandings that precede a spell, including any pertinent [models](Models) and constituent [formulae](Formulae.md). As such, various methods of recording spells, called scripts, have been created to maintain consistency between spellcasters. 

At a base-level understanding, a script is a writing standard that concisely packages all necessary information for a spell to be studied, learned, and cast. Each different script includes different information about spells, creating different learning styles based off of which script is used. Listed below is each script and a brief description of their general teaching style.

[[Hessan Narrative Method\|Hessan Narrative Method]]: A script which uses a description of the casting of a spell to induce [insight](Insight.md) in a reader, leading to spell acquisition. 
[[Hessan Spellcaster Standard\|Hessan Spellcaster Standard]]: A script which describes requisite models in great detail, then derives the spell using its variables.
