## Overview
The [[Provinces/Forgon\|Forgon]] ice clam is a small bivalve that grows in the northeast of the [Hessan](Hessa) commonwealth. The clam feeds on small particulate life that populates the water in the area, filtering the waters and making them brilliantly clear. The clams don't often grow to more than three inches across, but they grow in great abundance, making them a common sight in [Hessan](Hessa) waterways. The meat inside of the clams is tough and muscular, but, if cooked for a long amount of time, can be prepared into a tasty and satisfying protein in soups and stews. Occasionally, the small clams will produce pearls when foreign objects or microscopic creatures infect the internal cavities of the clam. The pearls have little practical use outside of niche alchemical application; however, their pale emerald sheen is prized in jewelry and [sometimes used in trade](Currency).
