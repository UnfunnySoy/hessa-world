## Overview
The [Hessan](Hessa) great cow is a large bovine creature about 7 foot tall, 3 foot wide, and 11 foot long on average. The cow has a heavy, long coat of brown fur that covers the body and protects it from the elements as it inhabits the dangerous northern cold of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. Often raised for agricultural purposes, the great cow has a large part in [Hessan](Hessa) cuisine and culture, providing resources for heavy winter clothes, meat and milk for hearty winter meals, and [throny](Throny.md), a substance similar to ivory (although much less rare or costly) often used in making items of cultural significance. [[Mundane Items/Throny\|Throny]] is a bone-like material that grows around the joints and sensitive areas of the cow, producing organic plates of armor that help protect against predators. The meat harvested from the cow is often stringy and difficult to eat unless first tenderized using a marinade or applied effort, and even then the meat is typically more tough than a well-done steak. There is a rather fatty cut of meat found about the stomach area where large plates of throny are produced that is often prepared for special meals. [[Mundane Items/Throny\|Throny]] has use as an alchemical ingredient, often being powdered and used as a basis for a number of tinctures and salves.
