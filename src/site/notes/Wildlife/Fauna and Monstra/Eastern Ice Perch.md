## Overview
The eastern ice perch is a large freshwater fish that inhabits lakes and ponds in the northern provinces of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. The fish has a vibrant greenish-yellow sheen with three easily-identifiable sets of frills that trace the spine of the fish. The perch can grow up to a foot long and weigh up to 4 pounds with a decent portion of the weight coming from protective fat stores that insulate the fish against the cold. The flesh of the fish has a mild sweet taste with a firm, flaky texture. When cooked slowly, the fat stores in the fish have enough time to break down and fry the fish from the inside, creating a crisp, but delightfully tender meal. When in the wild, the eastern ice perch likes to school in groups of up to twenty fish and feed on crayfish and other small invertebrates, the eggs and offspring of other fish, and various seagrasses. The scales and fat of the fish have some use in alchemy in creating potions of water breathing and draughts of healing respectively.
