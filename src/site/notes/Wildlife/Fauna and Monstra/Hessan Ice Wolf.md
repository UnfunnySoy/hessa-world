## Overview
The [Hessan](Hessa) ice wolf is a species of wolf that inhabits the cold boreal forests of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. Adapted to live in snowy environments, ice wolves have a stark white coat for camouflage and ambushing prey in their frozen territories. Larger, stronger, and more intelligent than typical wolves, the [Hessan](Hessa) ice wolf is a natural born hunter and stalker, often making quick work of prey thanks to its strong jaw, fast legs, and instinctual ice affinity. Ice wolves are often regarded in towns and civilizations as a true beast due to their cunning, ruthlessness, and physical capability. Ice wolves often form packs of anywhere from 4 to 12 members, typically with 1 elder wolf and a number of hunters. Oftentimes, elder wolves and hunters have shown magical abilities learned through [insight](Insight.md), though aided through instinct. This typically manifests as bursts of frigid, freezing air, but a few travelers have stated that they have seen other, more dangerous utilizations of this primal form of magic. These wolves, thanks to their great strength, have been known to pick fights with most creatures, often targeting the [[Wildlife/Fauna and Monstra/Hessan Great Cow\|Hessan Great Cow]], [glangeese flocks](Glangoose.md), and more rarely hunting the [spideer](Spideer.md) when territories overlap.
