## Overview
The xanthous crab is a relatively large crab with deep yellowish-orange chitin. The crab is found in bulk in the [[Gulf of Freithel\|Gulf of Freithel]] and in clusters around the outer coasts of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. The crabs have a wide variety of color, with crabs found in more southern regions of [[Hessa\|Hessa]] having a deep amber hue and crabs found in more northern regions having a pale lemon coloration. The crab is often used in coastal dishes and meals often served with butter and spices, creating a savory and delicious meal. The meat is soft and supple, with a slight sweetness and inherent saltiness from the ocean water. Fishermen often use cages to catch the crabs in bulk, but crabs have also begun to be grown in small breeding pools on land as well. The breeding pools are often rare, requiring maintenance by an experienced spellcaster. Some xanthous crabs have been known to grow to absurd sizes; however, this is typically very rare and not common to find naturally. Xanthous crab chitin have been known to be used in potions to increase stamina, endurance, and mental fortitude when prepared correctly.
