## Overview
The spideer is an ungodly cross of both a spider and a deer. The spideer is best described as a deer with eight eyes, eight legs, an elongated head and face with mandibles, an emphasized and enlarged abdomen, light exoskeletal protrusions, and many long climbing hairs and trichobothria used for sensing their surroundings. The spideer often lives in the more southern regions of [[Hessa\|Hessa]], making their homes amongst the temperate boreal forests and spruce thickets. Spideer are often regarded as abominations due to their nightmarish figure, and they are often left isolated. Spideer are largely territorial, producing large, webbed swaths of forest that create dangerous and hostile ecosystems where life goes to die. Spideer are omnivorous creatures, often foraging for fruits and vegetables and setting traps for smaller mammals. Spideer, although rarely hunted, produce good, although gamey, meat. Inside of the web-producing organs of the spideer, an enzyme is produced that is sometimes utilized to make potions of climbing and potions of freedom of movement.
