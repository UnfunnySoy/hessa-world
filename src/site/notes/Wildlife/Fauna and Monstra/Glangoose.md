## Overview
The glangoose is a large, goose-like creature that inhabits the [[Hessa\|Hessan]] commonwealth. The glangoose is a very typical avian often hunted and sometimes raised in both the [[Hessa\|Hessan]] north and south. The glangoose is a favored hunt for inhabitants of small settlements in the south of the commonwealth, with hunting trips often netting hunters 3 or 4 geese at a time: enough for a few days worth of meals. The glangoose is not very intelligent, although it is notably curious, making it exceptionally easy to trap under the right conditions. The Glangoose has distinct migratory patterns, often flying to the south of the commonwealth where it lays its eggs during the winters and to the north during the muggy summers. The glangoose typically has little use outside of hunting for its meat; however, some alchemists and apothecaries have claimed that powdered glangoose bones have similar applications to [[Mundane Items/Materials/Throny\|throny]] in medicine and potions and torn feathers can produce potions of wakefulness, speed, and flight in some cases.
