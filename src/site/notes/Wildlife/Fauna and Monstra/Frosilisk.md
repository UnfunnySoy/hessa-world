## Overview
The frosilisk is a huge, snake-like creature that inhabits northern [[Hessa\|Hessan]] ice caves. The frosilisk is a very ancient creature, known only in folklore and legend as a horror and plague to unfortunate nearby villages. Growing to lengths greater than 170 feet, the frosilisk is a massive creature that requires a great amount of shelter. The frosilisk feeds on the life essence of live creatures, using its icy frame to first immobilize a victim by constriction. After a victim is rendered immobile, the frosilisk then extracts life force by looking into the eyes of the victim, freezing them into an icy statue. As such, a frosilisk lair is often adorned with the statues of warriors from ages past, frozen into solid sculptures of ice and frost.
