## Overview
The mistbear is the pinnacle of the food chain of natural animals in [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. Although it hunts very little due to its slow metabolism and its ability to conserve energy through hibernation, the mistbear is a truly frightening enemy. Much larger than a typical bear, the mistbear takes up considerable space with its hulking frame and significant muscle mass. Although the mistbear is notably slower than similar animals, it makes up for its lack in speed with the ability to teleport. The mistbear, through [instinct](Insight.md) and drive, is able to teleport short distances through clouds of mist, making it an unpredictable and highly dangerous opponent. This ability to teleport, paired with precise strength in its claw and bite attacks makes the mistbear an impressive hunter, being able to quickly dispatch creatures who find their way into their territory. Although typically less active in the ecosystem due to their hibernation schedules, during the springtime mating season, mistbears become more active, often able to be spotted on forested trails. During this time, mistbears are  less territorial in order to attract a mate; however, spring becomes a dangerous time to travel as the bears travel.
