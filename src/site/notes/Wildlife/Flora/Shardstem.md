## Overview
The shardstem is a fibrous plant with hard, ice-like protrusions and growths. Shardstem bushes are not much more than five feet in diameter. The outer portions of the bushes and leaves take on a sky blue color while the inner flesh of the plant is a thin, snow-white fiber that expels a translucent, milky, sticky sap when cut. This plant is very resilient and can be found growing in the snow as far up north as [[Civilizations/Felmsgrace\|Felmsgrace]]. They are often used for making clothing, ropes, mats, walls, insulations, parchments, yarns, and more. Luxury canvas and tapestries made using high-end shardstem fibers are sold in auctions in cities to be used by professional artists and painters. The sap found in the plants is bitter and unappetizing, but is sometimes used in potions and teas to help increase the bodyâ€™s ability to retain heat; however, too much sap can act as a poison, making the ingester sickly and dehydrated while also giving mild hallucinations.
