## Overview
The meadwood mushroom is a flattened, burnt-amber fungus often foraged by travelers through the [Hessan](Hessa) commonwealth. The mushroom grows in thick discus shapes on the edges of fallen trees and also sprouts from the ground in small, rose-like spirals. Meadwood, when eaten raw, has a distinct gritty texture with a potent and sickening sweetness not dissimilar to contaminated mead. After ingesting a raw meadwood mushroom, the stomach becomes severely irritated and the consumer becomes nauseous, often vomiting or otherwise involuntarily voiding their bowels. When dried and powdered, the mushroom becomes a concentrated, [poisonous](Poisons) powder which can induce vomiting when consumed. If grilled, steamed, or otherwise cooked, the mushroom becomes a supple, fleshy snack with a light earthy flavor.
