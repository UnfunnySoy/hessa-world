## Overview
The [[Brayshor Circle\|Brayshor]] apple tree is a medium-sized deciduous tree that grows beautiful sapphire apples. Atypical from regular apple trees which produce frequent red or green fruits, the [[Brayshor Circle\|Brayshor]] apple tree produces bushels of small, royal blue apples which are prized for their color and unique taste often described as having an apparent sweetness with residual, punchy juniper spice. The apples themselves are often used in luxury desserts, alcohol, and meals, leveraging different aspects of the appleâ€™s complex taste to conjure unique and indulgent flavors. [[Brayshor Circle\|Brayshor]] apple trees are uncommon throughout Hessa, as the apples do not contain the necessary seeds needed for reproduction. Instead, druids of the [[Brayshor Circle\|Brayshor Circle]] learn a ritual to produce the seeds to grow these wondrous trees. The powdered bark of the [[Brayshor Circle\|Brayshor]] apple tree has miraculous healing capabilities, often sought as an ingredient in elixirs and draughts that quickly close wounds and treat most common illnesses.
