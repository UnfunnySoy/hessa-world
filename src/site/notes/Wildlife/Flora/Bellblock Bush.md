## Overview
The bellblock bush is a hardy green plant that grows the bellblock berry. The bush grows in more cold, temperate climates often not growing much higher than the city of [[Civilizations/Helpherfrust\|Helpherfrust]]. The bellblock berry has a deep purple color and bulbous shape that makes it somewhat reminiscent of the blackberry, and its abundance makes it a popular and quick snack for travelers and hunters alike. The berry itself has a rich, honey-like sweetness with a slight bitter-caramel aftertaste. The bellblock berry is often used as an ingredient in baked goods and pastries, jams, jellies, alcohols, and candies, making the bellblock bush and its subsequent berries one of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]'s most popular local plants. The berry and its seeds often acts as a common cold medicine, antihistamine, and fever reducer, but its sweet flavors are often lost when processed into medicine in favor of its bitter-caramel notes.
