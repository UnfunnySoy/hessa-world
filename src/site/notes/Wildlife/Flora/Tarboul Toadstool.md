## Overview
The tarboul toadstool is a black, rounded mushroom. The mushroom grows commonly deep in the wooded regions of [[Hessa\|Hessa]]. The toadstool is often found growing on fallen trees, breaking down rotting wood. The mushroom is poisonous in a way that causes the throat to tighten with a horrible burning sensation an hour after ingesting. Once the mushroom is cut open and drained of its viscous inner fluids, the flesh of the toadstool can be consumed. The fluids inside of the mushroom are sticky and thick, making them useful in applications where glue or tar fall short. If the fluids are distilled in a specific process, a delicate and potent [poison](Poisons) is created. This poison, if ingested, causes throat and stomach irritation in a violent and abrupt way, causing esophagus muscles to tighten and close airways. Additionally, the poison weakens membranes in the stomach, causing ulcers and gastric perforations which can be fatal.
