## Overview
The inerga root is a dark orange root often described as a cross between a carrot and a sweet potato. The root grows in the more temperate regions of [[Hessa\|Hessa]] where the sun is more abundant and warm. The root, when eaten raw, has a stimulating effect which raises heart rate and makes the body quicker; a property frequently exploited by alchemists to create medicines to flush toxins from the body and potions of swiftness. When cooked, the root loses its stimulating properties; however, it can be fashioned into various savory and subtly sweet dishes. The inerga root is the most common agricultural product of [[Hessa\|Hessa]], often being transported throughout to be eaten in about half of all meals. Its versatility paired with nonnative vegetables, other grown products, and animal proteins make hearty and satisfying meals.
